The first step to forecast demand for perishable goods is to understand your product life cycle, which is the time from when the product is produced or acquired until it expires or becomes unsellable. The product life cycle can vary depending on the type, quality, storage, and handling of the product. For example, fresh fruits and vegetables have a shorter life cycle than canned or frozen ones. You should know the average and minimum life cycle of your products, as well as the factors that can affect it, such as temperature, humidity, or exposure to light.

You should collect and organize data on your sales, inventory levels, and customer feedback for each product and time period.
